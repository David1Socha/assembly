assembly
==============

The assembler I created for CSCE 230's processor project.

##Usage:
>
>Ruby must be installed to use this assembler. 
>Navigate to \lib and enter "ruby assemble_code.rb".
>Alternatively, you may pass input and output file names as command line arguments. This is done with the format "ruby assemble_code.rb <SOURCE_FILE> <OUTPUT_FILE>"
